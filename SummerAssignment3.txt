Third and final C++/SFML assignment

The third and final C++/SFML assignment is to reimplement the game Flappy Bird, with a few
twists (see below). The two games so far have had fixed screens -- Flappy Bird has a scrolling
screen. 

 

Your version of Flappy Bird must have:

 

* Flappy Bird title screen

* Instruction screen when you start playing

* While your version of the game doesn't have to have exactly the same challenges as the
original, it does need to present the same challenge to player, play after play. That is, the 
ind of tubes, size of tubes, and location of tubes must be the same from game to game. No
random generation on each playthrough. Part of the implementation challenge is representing
these tubes and their locations, and then getting them on screen at the appropriate time.

* Game over screen

* Very similar flappy bird behavior -- quick rise up, heavy gravity, fast forward progress

 

This is due Friday, September 11, with the same deliverables as always, YouTube video and Code
on Github.
